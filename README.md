# Andika

![](https://github.com/m0g/andika/raw/master/static/andika.png)

Andika is a simple open source word processor built on top of the [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell). It reuses popular ideas from distraction free plain text editor.

Instead of being yet another markdown editor, andika uses markdown as a file storing format. The edition itself remaining purely HTML with basic formatting capabilities.

This software is aimed at writers, journalists and students.
